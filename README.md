# Moon Lander game.

Game based at tutorial http://www.gametutorial.net/article/Keyboard-input---Moon-lander .
My outcome of this tutorial has some additives:

1. Flying meteors which makes game more difficult. We have to watch speed and position of our rocket and avoid meteors.
2. Graphics in change of direction (left and right) - additional fire on sides of  rocket.
3. Sounds.

## In this game u have to land on the moon in the marked area. Furthermore you can't collide with meteors.
